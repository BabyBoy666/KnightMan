***This is the explenation for the game and what it does***

This game was created by [ElliotMassey](https://replit.com/@ElliotMassey) for the purpose of entertainment. So enjoy.

Elliot Massey created the code while [BenjaminWatts1](https://replit.com/@BenjaminWatts1) created the readme and some of the sounds,
and some of the images such as the fireball in the bossfight scene.


**here are some examples of the audio clips.**
